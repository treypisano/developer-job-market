Technologies, frameworks, and languages are always changing in software development. I wanted to find out exactly what employers were looking for, so I decided to make a tool which organizes job listings by language. This is intended to inform programmers about which languages and technologies they might consider learning to improve their job prospects.

This tool will use aggregates of thousands of columns of job listing information to find average salary, job listings, and locations on a (coding) language basis. It will then visualize this data in a way which makes it easy to understand and interpret. 

Functionality and MVPs

- Display languages based off popularity
- Select a language for more details
- Return from language page to home page
- A production readme
